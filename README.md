General-purpose C tools, vintage ANSI.  Some are self-educational:  e.g.
teaching myself about how various checksum and crypto algorithms work.  Others
I use regularly in development work, e.g. `d2h`, `h2d`, `jot`, `hex`, and `unhex`.

* crypto, checksum, and pseudo-random routines
* `dos2unix`/`unix2dos`
* `hex`/`unhex`
* disk-space viewer: `kdu`
  * For a newer, Python implementation please see [treedu](https://github.com/johnkerl/scripts/blob/main/fundam/treedu)

Most of my dev environment is scripted (https://github.com/johnkerl/scripts);
these are a few C items.

These tools are released under the terms of the BSD two-clause license.
